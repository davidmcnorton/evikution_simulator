# Evolution Simulator

## Overview

The **Evolution Simulator** models the interactions between static plants and dynamic animals within various regions. Plants serve as static food sources, while animals move, consume plants for energy, and reproduce based on resource intake.

## Features

- **Static Plants:**
  - Serve as food sources for animals.
  - Regenerate resources based on environmental factors.
- **Dynamic Animals:**
  - Move within the environment based on speed traits.
  - Consume plants to gain energy.
  - Reproduce when energy thresholds are met.
  - Die when energy depletes.
- **Real-time Visualization:**
  - **Live Map:** Displays positions of plants (green dots) and animals (red dots) across regions.
  - **Real-time Plot:** Shows average fitness over generations per region.
- **Detailed Tooltips:**
  - Hover over lifeforms on the live map to view detailed information, including ID, type, region, fitness, and traits.
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Start, pause, and reset the simulation.
  - Adjust mutation rates and the number of generations.
